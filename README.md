# Arduino MEGA communication with a Variable Frequency Drive over Modbus protocol

An example of communication between arduino MEGA and variable frequency drive over Modbus.

I've used this code as basis for one of the projects I've been involved. We've automated the 7.5kW blower for wheat drying process.

We've used a Machtric VFD and decided to control it over the Modubus, since it opens a wide range of possibilities (not just standard run/stop/frequency commands.
